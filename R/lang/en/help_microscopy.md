The use of microscopy for malaria diagnosis or verification of a negative RDT result will negate the advantage conferred by *pfhrp2\/3* deletions.

We have modelled three levels for each microscopy usage:

**Optimistic**: Highest microscopy usage.

**Central**: Most likely scenario based upon literature and survey data.

**Worst**: Lowest microscopy usage.
