The selection of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions is dependent upon treatment seeking behavior, use of microscopy and adherence to RDT. High treatment seeking, adherence to RDT outcomes and use of RDTs increases the likelihood of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions spreading. 

We have modelled three levels for each parameter:

**Optimistic**: Lowest treatment seeking, adherence to RDT outcomes and RDT use.

**Central**: Most likely scenario based upon literature and survey data.

**Worst**: Highest treatment seeking, adherence to RDT outcomes and RDT use.
