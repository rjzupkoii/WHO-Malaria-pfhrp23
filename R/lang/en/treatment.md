The selection of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions is dependent upon treatment seeking behavior and RDT outcomes. Higher treatment seeking and adherence to RDT outcomes increases the likelihood of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions spreading. We have used three levels for each parameter:

**Optimistic**: Preferred outcomes from a public health perspective (ex., more treatment seeking).

**Central**: Most likely scenario based upon literature and survey data.

**Worst**: Poor outcomes from a public health perspective (ex., reduced treatment seeking).
