The selection of hrp2\/3 deletions is dependent upon treatment seeking behavior and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) outcomes. Higher treatment seeking and adherence to RDT outcomes increases the likelihood of hrp2\/3 deletions spreading. We have used three levels for each parameter:

**Optimistic**

Preferred outcomes from a public health perspective (ex., more treatment seeking).

**Central**

Most likely scenario based upon literature and survey data.

**Worst**

Poor outcomes from a public health perspective (ex., reduced treatment seeking).
