**Prospective Risk**

Prospective risk is a measure of how quickly *pfhrp2\/3* deletions are predicted to spread in Africa based on current estimates from the WHO Malaria Threat Maps and assumed speeds for spreading between regions. We assign risk by how quickly regions reach the WHO threshold for recommending a switch in front-line RDT due to *pfhrp2\/3*, which is determined by more than 5% of clinically relevant infections being misdiagnosed due to *pfhrp2\/3* gene deletions.

- High Risk: >5% in 6 years
- Medium Risk: >5% in 12 years
- Low Risk: >5% in 20 years
- Marginal Risk: <5% in 20 years
- No data: Region was not included due to low to zero malaria prevalence
