The selection of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions is dependent upon malaria prevalence. Lower malaria prevalence selects for gene deletions more quickly and consequentially regions with lower malaria prevalence are at higher risk for *pfhrp2\/3* deletions spreading.  

We have modelled three malaria prevalence levels for each region based upon Malaria Atlas Project projections and their impact on selection of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions:

**Optimistic**: Highest estimate of malaria prevalence.

**Central**: Central estimate of malaria prevalence.

**Worst**: Lowest estimate of malaria prevalence.
