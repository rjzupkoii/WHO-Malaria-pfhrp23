**Innate Risk**

Innate risk is a measure of how quickly *pfhrp2\/3* deletions are predicted to spread once in a region. We assume that each region has a starting frequency of 6% *pfhrp2*-deletion and then assign risk by how quickly regions reach a specific frequency.

- High Risk represents >20% infection due to only *pfhrp2*-deleted mutants in 6 years.
- Medium Risk represents >20% infection due to only *pfhrp2*-deleted mutants in 12 years.
- Low Risk represents >20% infection due to only *pfhrp2*-deleted mutants in 20 years.
