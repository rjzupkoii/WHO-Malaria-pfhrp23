**Innate Risk**

Innate risk is a measure of how quickly *pfhrp2\/3* deletions are predicted to spread once in a region. We assume that each region has a starting frequency of 1% *pfhrp2*-deletions and then assign risk by how quickly regions reach the WHO threshold for recommending a switch in front-line RDT due to *pfhrp2\/3*, which is determined by more than 5% of clinically relevant infections being misdiagnosed due to *pfhrp2\/3* gene deletions.

- High Risk: >5% in 6 years.
- Medium Risk: >5% in 12 years.
- Low Risk: >5% in 20 years.
- Marginal Risk: <5% in 20 years.
