The selection of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions is dependent upon malaria prevalence. Lower malaria prevalence selects for gene deletions more quickly and consequentially regions with lower malaria prevalence are at higher risk for *pfhrp2\/3* deletions spreading. We have modeled three malaria prevalence levels for each country based upon Malaria Atlas Project projections:

**Optimistic**: Upper estimate of malaria prevalence.

**Central**: Central estimate of malaria prevalence.

**Worst**: Worst estimate of malaria prevalence.
