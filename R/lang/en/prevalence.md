The selection of hrp2\/3 deletions is dependent upon malaria prevalence. Lower malaria prevalence selects for gene deletions more quickly and consequentially regions with lower malaria prevalence are at higher risk for hrp2\/3 deletions spreading. We have modeled three malaria prevalence levels for each country:

**Optimistic**

**Central**

**Worst**
