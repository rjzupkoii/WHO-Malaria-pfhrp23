When the non-adherence to RDT outcomes increases (i.e., RDT negative individuals are given treatment for malaria) the selective advantage for *pfhrp2\/3* deletions to evade treatment is negated, increasing the time it takes to spread.

We have modelled three levels for adherence to RDT outcomes:

**Optimistic**: Lowest adherence to RDT outcomes.

**Central**: Most likely scenario based upon literature data.

**Worst**: Highest adherence to RDT outcomes.
