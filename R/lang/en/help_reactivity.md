HRP3 is known to cross-react and may yield a positive HRP2-based RDT even if *pfhrp2* is deleted. This reduces the selective advantage for the deletion and increases the time it takes to spread.

We have modelled three levels for cross-reactivity:

**Optimistic**: Most likely to cross-react.

**Central**: Most likely scenario based upon literature data.

**Worst**: Least likely to cross-react.
