## Introduction

For nearly two decades, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been deployed for the diagnosis of *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria. Most of these RDTs rely on the detection of  the *P. falciparum* histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its paralog *P. falciparum* histidine-rich protein 3 (PfHRP3). However, continued reliance on these RDTs is being threatened by the emergence of mutated parasites that lack the *pfhrp2* +/- 3 genes and do not express the HRP2 protein, leading to false-negative RDT results. 

Since 2017, WHO has been tracking reports of *pfhrp2/3* deletions and posting results on the [Malaria Threat Maps](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/). WHO has also recommended that when specific thresholds are met, countries should shift away from an exclusive reliance on HRP2 based Pf-diagnosis.  Determining if this threshold has been met, requires periodic surveillance and has been challenging for countries to implement, especially in the face of many competing priorities.  Additionally, manufacturers are reluctant to invest in innovation unless they can anticipate where and when the need for non-exclusive HRP2 based RDTs will emerge. To this end WHO commissioned modelers at Imperial College and Pennsylvania State University, to develop a model that might help predict where the risk of *pfhrp2* deletions emerging and having a clinical impact was highest. This would allow national programmes, donors, researchers, manufacturers and test developers to see where surveillance should be targeted and where markets for new tests would most likely emerge first. The model predicts a crude timeline for when *pfhrp2* deletions are most likely to reach a threshold where it is advisable for countries to transition away from exclusively HRP2-based RDTs to alternative diagnostic methods. The model  is dependent upon several factors, which may select for *pfhrp2* deletions: malaria transmission intensity, treatment-seeking, testing patterns, and RDT usage. The objective of this *pfhrp2/3* deletion risk explorer is to allow users to explore how changes in the underlying modeling assumptions impact the risk of *pfhrp2/3* continuing to spread.


## Model Description

An individual-based mathematical model of *P. falciparum* malaria transmission was used to simulate the selection of *pfhrp2* deletions based upon several model parameters (Watson et al. 2023). For each parameter, estimates from 2020 were used and assumed to remain constant over time. Six of the key drivers associated with the spread of pfhrp2 deletions can be explored using this application:

| <div style="width: 13.5em">Drivers of selection</div> | Impact on selection | Model data source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Treatment Seeking Rate | Increased treatment seeking and testing with HRP2-RDTs (which is desirable) will actually increase the rate at which the selective advantage conferred by *pfhrp2/3* is realized by these parasites evading diagnosis and treatment. | [Commodities Forecast Dashboard](https://data.malariaatlas.org/case-management) by the [Malaria Atlas Project](https://malariaatlas.org/), which uses Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS) in generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to predict treatment seeking patterns over time. |
| HRP3 Cross-Reactivity | HRP3 is known to cross-react and may yield a positive HRP2-based RDT even if *pfhrp2* is deleted, which will decrease the selective advantage. | Estimate based upon [WHO Malaria Threat Maps](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/) Data and studies of the performance of HRP2-based RDTs on *pfhrp2-\/pfhrp3+* samples ([Agaba et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-020-03362-x); [Feleke et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00962-4); [Rogier et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2810.220695)) |
| Adherence to RDT Outcomes | Increased non-adherence (which is not desirable) to RDT outcomes (i.e., treating an RDT negative individual) will negate the selective advantage of *pfhrp2/3* deletions. | [Commodities Forecast Dashboard](https://data.malariaatlas.org/case-management) by the [Malaria Atlas Project](https://malariaatlas.org/), which uses a statistical model of the probability of care-seeking fevers receiving any antimalarial informed by DHS and MIS data. |
| Microscopy Based Diagnosis | The use of microscopy for malaria diagnosis will negate the advantage conferred by *pfhrp2\/3* deletions. | [WHO World Malaria Report](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports)'s "proportion of cases confirmed by diagnostic" table, with missing data imputed using all other collected model parameters. |
| Malaria Prevalence | Lower prevalence will increase selection by increasing the likelihood that individuals are infected by only  pfhrp2/3 deleted parasites and are less likely to be treated because of a false-negative HRP-2 RDT. | [Malaria Atlas Project](https://malariaatlas.org/) maps of blood slide positivity for ages two to ten (*Pf*PR<sub>2-10</sub>) |
| Deletion Fitness | Fitness costs associated with pfhrp2/3 gene deletions will reduce the transmissibility of gene deleted parasites and therefore, low fitness is a selective disadvantage. | Based on an in-vitro laboratory assessment of fitness ([Nair et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiac240)) and pfhrp2/3 surveillance data from Eritrea and Ethiopia.  |
