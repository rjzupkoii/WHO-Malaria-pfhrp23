The selection of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions is dependent upon treatment seeking behavior. While a higher treatment seeking is desirable, it increases the chance of the mutation occurring or spreading. 

We have modelled three levels for treatment seeking:

**Optimistic**: Lowest treatment seeking, least selective pressure for deletions.

**Central**: Most likely scenario based upon literature and survey data.

**Worst**: Highest treatment seeking, most selective pressure for deletions.
