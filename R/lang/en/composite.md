**Composite Risk**

Composite risk is a measure of how quickly *pfhrp2\/3* deletions are predicted to spread to each region based upon the current understanding of where the deletions are present and assumed speeds for spreading between regions. We assign risk by how quickly regions reach a specific frequency.

- High Risk represents >20% infection due to only *pfhrp2*-deleted mutants by 2026.
- Medium Risk represents >20% infection due to only *pfhrp2*-deleted mutants by 2030.
- Low Risk represents >20% infection due to only *pfhrp2*-deleted mutants by 2040.
