The spread of hrp2\/3 deletions is dependent its fitness versus the wild type. In vitro evidence suggests that the gene deletions have reduced competitive growth rates compared to wild type. We have modeled three for the fitness costs:

**Optimistic**

The hrp2\/3 deletion has a fitness cost that is *significantly higher* than in vitro evidence suggests.

**Central**

Most likely fitness cost based upon in vitro evidence.

**Worst**

The hrp2\/3 deletion has a fitness cost that is *significantly lower* than in vitro evidence suggests.
