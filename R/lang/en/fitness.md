The spread of *pfhrp2\/3* deletions is dependent on the fitness of deleted parasite relative to non-deleted (wild type) parasites. In vitro evidence suggests that the gene deletions have reduced competitive growth rates compared to wild type. There is also supporting observational evidence from Eritrea, in which the frequency of deletions was found to decrease in one administrative unit after switching away from HRP2-based RDTs.

We have modelled three different estimates for the fitness costs:

**Optimistic**: The *pfhrp2\/3* deletion has a fitness cost that is *significantly higher* than the evidence suggests.

**Central**: Most likely fitness cost based upon in vitro and observational evidence.

**Worst**: The *pfhrp2\/3* deletion has a fitness cost that is *significantly lower* than the evidence suggests.
